# todolist
I have successfully developed a dynamic ToDo List application utilizing the power of Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. This application serves as an efficient task management tool, allowing users to organize and prioritize their daily activities with ease.

Through my expertise in Java programming, I created the robust backend logic that powers the ToDo List's functionality. Users can seamlessly add, edit, and remove tasks, and the application ensures data persistence and retrieval for a seamless user experience.

To enhance the user interface, I harnessed the capabilities of JavaFX, a versatile graphical toolkit for Java applications. Leveraging JavaFX, I designed an intuitive and visually appealing interface that users can interact with effortlessly. The integration of JavaFX not only ensures a responsive and dynamic user experience but also contributes to the overall aesthetics of the application.

For the design and layout of the application's user interface, I employed Scene Builder. This powerful design tool allowed me to create a polished and user-centric UI without the need for extensive manual coding. With Scene Builder, I customized the layout, arranged elements, and established a coherent visual hierarchy that enhances usability.

In summary, my ToDo List application is a testament to my proficiency in Java programming, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. By combining these technologies, I have crafted an application that empowers users to efficiently manage their tasks while enjoying a seamless and visually engaging experience.
